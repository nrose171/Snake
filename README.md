# Snake
Snake game created in c++ with the ncurses.h library and NodeLists.

Hello all,
This will be my first project I am posting on here so please give me as much feedback as possible! If you have any suggestions, criticisms, or bug discoveries(of which I'm sure there are many) please do not hesitate to leave a comment.
When I started this project I wanted to build a snake game that ran straight off the linux terminal, so it is not very pretty, but I may decide to add more ncurses elements to the game to make it more graphically appealing.
I realize that LinkedLists are not the best structures for these sorts of things, but this is just what made the most sense to me.
I will also work on fixing any bugs eventually.

#To Run
This project was built to run straight off linux terminal. Required components include g++ version 5.4 or higher, and ncurses library. Use the make file to run, and ./main to start.

Thank you all,
Nathaniel Rose
